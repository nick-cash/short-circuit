Short Circuit is a floaty, spacey shoot'em up / bullet hell game. You control a spacecraft through a perilously random region of space. Thankfully, random canisters of useful items are here to help you, but your ship can only handle each one for ten seconds. You also lose fuel every ten seconds (or when you hit something), so make sure to grab more!

Good luck random space adventurer.

Gameplay:

Control the ship with the arrow keys. Hold 'SHIFT' for more precise movements. Your ship is not capable of anything beyond movement on its own, so grab powerups to gain temporary abilities.

There are no additional keys for the powerups - they function automatically. Weapons will start firing immediately, but some powerups trigger/go off after 10 seconds.

While we integrated with Tiled to make levels, we ran out of time to do anything elaborate. What you are playing is a mix between a crazy user generated level and procedurally generated spawns.

Thanks for playing! :)
